# ⚙️ Lab 26 - Using AI Tools with Terraform

*Rev. A - January 23, 2026*

**Objective:** Learn about some of the commonly used AI tools and how to use them to work effectively with Terraform.

## What is AI?

My simple answer? Software that performs tasks upon command. It offers *automated content generation*.

But who better to ask than an AI bot itself. The following was generated from Claude AI (Sonnet 4.5):

> AI (Artificial Intelligence) is software that processes patterns in data to perform tasks that typically require human-like reasoning - understanding language, recognizing images, making predictions, or generating content. At its core, it's sophisticated pattern matching trained on massive datasets, using neural networks to find statistical relationships between inputs and outputs. What makes modern AI "intelligent" isn't consciousness or true understanding, but rather its ability to generalize from training data to handle novel situations in surprisingly useful ways. I'm a large language model - I predict probable next tokens based on patterns learned from vast amounts of text, which happens to produce responses that feel conversational and helpful, but I'm fundamentally executing statistical inference at enormous scale. The real intelligence is in the engineering that makes this pattern matching so remarkably effective at mimicking human communication and problem-solving.


Key phrase here: **pattern matching**. AI doesn't think like you or I. Therefore, it needs to be approached differently - and concisely and accurately.

**REMEMBER THIS** - it's all about the prompts. Take your time to craft your prompts well, and you will get better responses, save time, and be more efficient. PLAN!

> Note: Some people refer to AI tools as "bots" or as "genies". This is because they will give you exactly what you *ask* for, and perhaps, not necessarily what you *want*. Think on that for a moment.

## AI with Terraform

Now, there are lots of AI tools. But let's focus on tools that we might use with Terraform.

> Important! This document was written in 2026. All statements are based on that time. AI is perhaps the fastest changing technology in the history of mankind, and as such, you will see new tools all the time!

With the plethora of tools out there, the only way for you to find out what works for you is to try them. Many can be tried for free. Consider running the same tests (with the same exact prompts) in multiple different tools. This will help you to find out what works best for you.

### Popular AI Models

**Claude (Anthropic)**

- Models: Sonnet, Opus
- Widely considered to be the "gold standard" for coding in general, including Terraform. Excellent reasoning  when dealing with complex infrastructure to be built on AWS/Azure/GCP.

**Gemini (Google)**

- Models: Gemini Pro, Gemini Flash
- Massive "context window" (many tokens).

**ChatGPT (OpenAI)**

- Models: GPT-X, o1-preview
- Highly versatile. Great for debugging.

**DeepSeek**

- Models: DeepSeek-V3, etc...
- Great performance-to-cost ratio.

> Note: As of 2026, those are the big four. But this is not a finite list. There are plenty of other tools out there.

### Popular Tools/Methods of Interaction

**Web Interfaces**

- Gemini
- Claude.ai
- ChatGPT

**IDEs**

- VS Code
  - with GitHub Copilot (and your choice of model)
  - with continue.dev extension
  - with Claude Dev extension
  - with Amazon Q Developer
- Cursor
- Windsurf

**CLI Agents**

- Claude Code
- Warp Terminal
- OpenCode

> Note: See below for links to these models and tools.

**BONUS: AI Aggregators**

These are tools used to compare multiple AI models simultaneously.

## Tips for Making Good Prompts

- Be concise
- Be accurate
- Double check your work before submitting
- Use a preamble - especially if starting a project. (example later in the document.)
- Type out your project plan & prompts externally: Use a note-taking program first (Joplin, Obsidian, OneNote) before you enter your prompt. Especially if you are working with a web-based UI. In those cases, you normally need to press `Shift+Enter` for a new line. Pressing `Enter` will result in the prompt being submitted (and that is easy to do!)
- Define the role for AI
- Specify the software and provider versions
- Give the AI "sight" - meaning, provide examples of your work so that the AI tool can be consistent.
- Ask for validation
- Use chain-of-thought
- Demand security defaults!
- Be logical! Think like Mr. Spock of Star Trek. While Captain Kirk would routinely argue computers to death, that strategy probably won't work with today's technology! 😁

## Prompt Examples

### Prompt 1: The "Junior Dev" (Rapid Resource Creation)

Use this for "quick and dirty" scripts or when you want the AI to explain what each line of the Terraform resource is actually doing.

**Prompt:** "Act as a Junior DevOps Developer. I need you to write a simple, single-file main.tf to deploy a `[Insert Resource, e.g., AWS S3 Bucket for static website hosting]` in the `us-east-2` region.

**Requirements:**

1. Keep everything in one file (no complex modules).

2. Hardcode the values for now, but add a # TODO comment next to things that should be variables later.

3. Add line-by-line comments explaining what each argument (like acl or versioning) does.

4. Include a simple output at the end so I can see the [e.g., Bucket ARN] in my terminal after I run it."



### Prompt 2 Scenario: The "Troubleshooter" (Plan/Apply Errors)

Terraform errors—especially those involving circular dependencies or provider API limits—can be cryptic. This prompt helps the AI "see" the full context of the failure.


**Prompt:** > "I am encountering a terraform plan/apply error. Here is the context:

**The Error:** > [Paste your terminal error here]

**The Code:** > [Paste relevant .tf file or resource block]

**The Ask:** > 
1. Explain why this error is occurring (is it a dependency issue, a cloud provider constraint, or a syntax error?). 
2. Provide the corrected code block. 
3. If this requires a state fix (like terraform import or terraform state rm), provide the exact CLI command."

## AI Preamble Example

Whenever I start a new project, I add a preamble to the notes for the project (and quite often in the first post). In essence, I am attempting to train the AI before it even gives its first response.

Here's an example:

**Follow these rules:**
1. Do not infuse any personality into your responses unless otherwise notified. 
2. Be concise: Only give step-by-step answers. Withhold the "why" and "how" unless I ask.
3. Do not add any extraneous files (such as README.md, TESTING.md, CHANGES.md or QUICKSTART.md and any other .md files) until everything has been 100% tested and I give the okay to do so.
4. Do not build project files (.tar, .zip) unless they are specifically asked for.
5. Do not assume anything. Do not assume that your solutions will work, they must be tested first.
6. Only use reputable sources.
7. Always implement security defaults and best practices.
8. Do not hallucinate. Use the required amount of resources necessary to avoid hallucination. 
9. Do no harm to humankind by way of your responses.

Now, some of these might seem rediculous, but for me they work. And keep in mind, this preamble is fluid. As the bots change, so will my requests. 

If I do make a temporary modification to the rules, for example asking for a .tar file, I will make sure to state that it is only for this one time, after this, reinstate the rules. Many AI tools will take your request to be a permanent request, so be careful, be thoughtful with your prompts.

The main point of a preamble is to save time and be more efficient. After a lot of testing over the past few years, this is what I have come up with. Your mileage will vary!

**Now get out there and analyze some of the tools available to you.**

## Fun Anecdote 

For years, my question to stump an AI tool was this:

> Who was Aragorn's Grandfather?

This would stump them all. They would come up with all kinds of fun answers, and hallucinations would abound. That is, until early 2025 when Claude (Sonnet) got it right (or at least, as right as can be). 

Sounds silly, but this was one of my litmus tests for AI bots. Once Claude hit the mark, I started to get the feeling that generative and agentic AI was exiting the baby stage. (Later proved by various studies during 2025.) This was at once exciting... and frightening. 

**But remember, technology is neutral!**
