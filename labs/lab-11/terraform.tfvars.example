# Example Terraform Variables Configuration
# Copy this to terraform.tfvars and customize as needed

# AWS Region (must be us-east-2 for this demo)
aws_region = "us-east-2"

# EC2 Instance Type (t2.micro is free tier eligible)
instance_type = "t2.micro"

# Instance Name Tag
instance_name = "terraform-test-instance"

# Optional: Uncomment to use explicit AWS credentials
# aws_access_key = "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE"
# aws_secret_key = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE"

# Note: It's more secure to use AWS CLI credentials or environment variables
# instead of hardcoding credentials in this file
