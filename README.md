Within this repository you will find companion labs for the HashiCorp Certified Terraform Associate (004) Complete Video Course which is available at:

***Links coming soon...***

The labs are designed to be followed when watching the corresponding videos.

During this course I use a Debian Linux virtual machine for the labs. If you want to follow along with me more accurately, consider using that or your favorite Linux distribution. See [this link](https://prowse.tech/linux-installs/) for detailed step-by-step instructions (and videos) on how to install Linux.

Also, be sure to check out the companion practice exams here:  

https://learning.oreilly.com/certifications/9780138190408/ 

You should see two 80-question practice exams. However, you must be a member of O'Reilly to view them.

**Enjoy!**

## Notes: 
> - To run the labs in this course I use a Debian Linux Virtual Machine with Visual Studio Code installed. I recommend a minimum of 2 CPUs and 4 GB of RAM as well as 30 GB storage space. 
> - Consider removing the hidden .git directory if you don't want to have Git tracking enabled for the repository.
> - I don't recommend forking this repository as there are changes made often. Instead, show your love by starring the repository!
