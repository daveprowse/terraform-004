## From the Amazon Website (Updated 2025) 

https://aws.amazon.com/free/free-tier-faqs/ 

> Quote: "The AWS Free Tier applies to participating services across our global regions. Your free usage under the AWS Free Tier is calculated each month across all regions and automatically applied to your bill. For example, you will receive 750 Amazon EC2 Linux Micro Instance hours for free across all of the regions you use, not 750 hours per region. Unused monthly usage will not roll over to future months. The AWS Free Tier is now available in China (ZHY) and China (BJS) regions as well. The AWS Free Tier is not available in the AWS GovCloud (US) regions, with the exception of Lambda for AWS GovCloud (US)."
